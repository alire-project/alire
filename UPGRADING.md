## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Changes in default storage locations mean that the following folders, if
existing, can be safely deleted to retrieve disk space:

- <userdir>/.cache/alire
- <userdir>/.config/alire/cache

On Windows, `<userdir>` stands for `%UserProfile%`, whereas for other OSes it
stands for `$HOME`.
