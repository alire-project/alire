# Since the solved dependencies may vary from the submodules pinned to a commit
# in ./deps, the result of `alr build` might differ from the same code built by
# GitHub actions. We might want to add, down the road, a way to propagate the
# version defined here into Ada code (perhaps by generating a metadata package
# before `alr build` that the code being built can "with" if so desired), so
# builds are uniquely identified without requiring manual editing or other
# preprocessing. We could also include info about all dependencies exact
# versions and environment used during the build.
