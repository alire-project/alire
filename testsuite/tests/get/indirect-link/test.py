# The crux of this test is to have a dependency that in turn depends on a
# linked dir: root -> tier1 -> tier2, where tier2 is linked or missing.
# For the bug to manifest, root must already depend on tier2 when tier1 is
# added. So the test adds root -> tier2, and later root -> tier1, causing:
#    root -> tier1 -> tier2
