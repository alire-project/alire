# ALR #

ALIRE: Ada LIbrary REpository.

A catalog of ready-to-use Ada libraries plus a command-line tool (`alr`) to obtain, build, and incorporate them into your own projects. It aims to fulfill a similar role to Rust's `cargo` or OCaml's `opam`.

### Caveat emptor ###

Documentation at this time is minimal. Expect further efforts in this direction until this warning is removed.

## TL;DR ##

Available for Debian stable / Ubuntu >=17.10 / macOS

`alr` is undergoing frequent changes in preparation for a first publicly announced beta. Hence, the current recommendation is to run the latest `master` branch version, and double-check in case of problems that no new PRs have been merged since your last compiled version.

To install run the following as user in a terminal, or see below for more details:

1. If running on macOS, `export OS=macOS`
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/alire-project/alire.git`
1. `cd alire`
1. `gprbuild -j0 -p -P alr_env`

After a succesful build, you will have a `bin/alr` executable that you can put in your path if desired.

To see available crates per platform/compiler, see the [alire-crates-ci](https://github.com/alire-project/alire-crates-ci) companion repository.

## Design principles ##

alr is tailored to userspace, in a similar way to Python's virtualenv. A project or workspace will contain all its dependencies.

At this time some projects require platform packages. In this case the user will be asked to authorize a `sudo` installation through the platform package manager.

Properties and dependencies of projects are managed through a TOML file. This file exists locally for working copies of projects, and the Alire community index stores the files corresponding to its projects.

The complete build environment is set up with another file generated by `alr` for every project: a GNAT aggregate project that specifies the paths of necessary dependencies, thus freeing the user from concerns about installation paths. The user simply adds the used projects to its own project GPR file with their simple name.

## Supported platforms ##
Alire requires a recent Ada 2012 compiler. In practice, this currently means GNAT GPL 2017 or GNAT FSF 7.2 onward. The continuous integration checks are run against Debian stable, Ubuntu LTS and the latest GNAT Community edition.

Note that, for projects that require platform-provided Ada libraries (such as Debian's GtkAda), the platform compiler will be used automatically, so even having GPL 2017 in older platforms some projects may be unavailable due to missing dependencies.

## Installation ##

At present, only the latest master version is recommended. To obtain it you need to perform a manual clone and build:

1. If running on macOS, `export OS=macOS`
1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/alire-project/alire.git`
1. `cd alire`
1. `gprbuild -j0 -p -P alr_env`

The executable will be found in `bin/alr`.

## First steps ##
The following miniguide shows how to obtain and build already packaged projects, and create your own. First, create or enter into some folder where you don't mind that new project folders are created by the `alr` tool

Run `alr` without arguments to get a summary of available commands.

Run `alr --help` for global options about verbosity.

Run `alr help <command>` for more details about a command.

### Downloading, compiling and running an executable project ###
Obtaining an executable project already cataloged in Alire is straightforward. We'll demonstrate it with the `hello` project which is a plain "Hello, world!" application (or you can use the `hangman` or `eagle_lander` projects as funnier alternatives).

Follow these steps:

1. Issue `alr get hello`
2. Enter the new folder you'll find under your current directory: `cd hello*`
3. Build and run the project with `alr run`. This will build and then launch the resulting executable.

As a shorthand, you can use `alr get --build hello` to get and build the program in one step.

### Creating a new project ###
Alire allows you to initialize an empty GNAT binary or library project with ease:

1. Issue `alr init --bin myproj` (you can use --lib for a library project).
2. Enter the folder: `cd myproj`
3. Check that it builds: `alr build`
4. Run it: `alr run`

## Dependencies and upgrading ##
Alire keeps track of a project dependencies in the file `./alire/project_name.toml` file of your project. You may check the one just created in the previous example.

This file can be managed through `alr`:

* `alr with project_name` adds a dependency. You can immediately 'with' its GPR project files and packages in your code.
* `alr with --del project_name` removes a dependency.
* `alr with --from yourproject.gpr` reads the given GPR file and adds dependencies specified in comments as alr invocations. For example:

    ```Ada
    with "xstrings"; -- alr with xstrings
    project My_Project is
    ```

Alternatively you can edit the file (example in the works) to add dependencies and then issue:

* `alr update`, which will fetch any additional dependencies in your project.

## Finding available projects ##

For quick listing of projects and its description you can use the `list` command:

* `alr list [substring]`

There's also a search command which provides more details:

* `alr search <substring>` will look for `substring` in project names.
* `alr search --list` will list the whole catalog.

Even more details are obtained with:

* `alr show <project>`

This last command will show generic information. To see the one that specifically applies to your platform:

* `alr show --native <project>`

## Troubleshooting ##

By default `alr` is quite terse and will hide the output of subprocesses, mostly reporting in case of failure. If you hit any problem, increasing verbosity (`-v` or even `-vv`) is usually enough to get an idea of the root of the problem. Additionally, `-d` will show tracebacks of exceptions.

## Running tests ##

`alr` comes with a test suite for self-checks. See the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/blob/master/testsuite/README.md) of the `testsuite` folder.

Additionally, you can test in batch the building of crates in your platform with the `alr test` command. (See `alr test --help` output for instructions.)

## Further reading ##

More comprehensive documentation is forthcoming, so stay tuned! Meanwhile, you can inspect [index files](https://github.com/alire-project/alire-index) to get an idea of how projects are included into the catalog.
