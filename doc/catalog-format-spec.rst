Catalog format specification
============================

Big picture
-----------

Each project is described as a TOML file. For instance: ``aaa.toml`` for the
AAA project, ``gnatcoll.toml`` for the package corresponding to GNATCOLL.

Each TOML description contains an object that has a ``general`` table and then
one table per release.

.. code-block:: toml

   [general]
   ...

   ['1.0']
   ...

   ['1.1']
   ...

   ['2.0']
   ...

``general`` contains information common to all releases, then each release
provides sources (``origin``) and can refine common information.


Information encoding
--------------------

This section describes the various encodings used in this format to encode
information.

First, there are two kinds of data: atomic and composite data.

Atomic data designates values that cannot be decomposed. There are only two
atomic data types:

* mere strings (``"Hello, world!"``);
* booleans (``true``, ``false``);

We can then split composite data in two kinds: lists (TOML's arrays) and
mappings (JSON's tables). Lists are just sequences of other values; for
instance a list of strings:

.. code-block:: toml

   ["A", "B"]

Mapping are the traditional sets of associations from keys (here, always
strings) to other values. For instance, the following represents a set of
dependencies, with version constraints:

.. code-block:: toml

   libfoo = "^1.2"
   libbar = "^2.0 & /=2.1.3" # Excluding a known bad version

In some contexts, information can be dynamic: special encodings can be used to
make data vary depending on the environment (OS, architecture, â€¦). The
environment is represented as a set of specific variables which can have
a specific set of values: see the Parameters section below for a comprehensive
list.

To create atomic values in an environment-dependent way, use the following
construct (here to create a boolean):

.. code-block:: toml

   {'case(distribution)' = {
       'debian|ubuntu': true,
       '...': false
   }}

   # Or in a more idiomatic TOML syntay
   ['case(distribution)']
   'debian|ubuntu' = true
   '...' = false

Depending on the value of the ``distribution`` environment variable, this will
return ``true`` (its value is ``debian`` or ``ubuntu``) or ``false`` (for other
values).

A little variation allows to build environment-dependent composite data. For
instance, to make the dependency on ``libbar`` above dynamic:

.. code-block:: toml

   {
       "libfoo": "^1.2",
       "case(os)": {
           "linux": {"libbar": "^2.0"},
           "windows": {"libwinbar": "^3.0"},
           "...": {}
       }
   }

   # Or in a more idiomatic TOML syntay
   libfoo = "^1.2"

   ['case(os)'.linux]
   libbar = "^2.0"

   ['case(os)'.windows]
   libwinbar = "^3.0"

   ['case(os)'.'...']

If the ``os`` environment variable contains ``linux``, this will create the
following dependencies:

.. code-block:: toml

   libfoo = "^1.2"
   libbar = "^2.0"

The ``case(os)`` part selects dependencies depending on the value of the ``os``
environment variable.

.. code-block:: toml

   libfoo = "^1.2"
   libwinbar = "^3.0"

And finally for other ``os`` values:

.. code-block:: toml

   libfoo = "^1.2"


General Information
-------------------

Unless specified, all the entries must be static, i.e. they cannot depend on
the context.

The ``general`` entry must contain an object. It contains itself the following
entries:

* ``description``: mandatory string. One-line description about the package.
  For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   description = "Library to handle foobars"


* ``long-description``: optional free-form string to provide information about
  this package, in addition to ``description``, without length restrictions.

* ``authors``: optional array of strings. Flat list of human-readable names for
  the authors, i.e. the people that wrote the software that is packaged. For
  instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   authors = ["Alice Example",
              "Bob For Instance <bob@example.com>"]

* ``maintainers``: mandatory array of strings. Flat list of human-readable
  names (optional) for the maintainers, with a contact email (mandatory); i.e.
  the people that maintain the crate metadata in Alire. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   maintainers = ["alice@example.com",
                  "Bob For Instance <bob@athome.com>"]

* ``maintainers-logins``: mandatory array of strings. Flat list of github login
  usernames used by the maintainers of the crate. This information is used to
  authorize crate modifications. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   maintainers-logins = ["alicehacks", "bobcoder"]

* ``licenses``: mandatory array of strings. Flat list of licenses for the
  software that is packaged. The following licenses are allowed:

    * ``AFL 3.0``, ``AGPL 3.0``, ``Apache 2.0``, ``Artistic 2.0``,
      ``BSD 2-Clauses``, ``BSD 3-Clauses Clear``, ``BSD 3-Clauses``,
      ``BSL 1.0``, ``CC0 1.0``, ``CC BY 4.0``, ``CC BY-SA 4.0``,
      ``ECL 2.0``, ``EPL 1.0``, ``EPL 2.0``, ``EUPL 1.1``, ``EUPL 1.2``,
      ``GPL 2.0``, ``GPL 3.0``, ``ISC``, ``LGPL 2.1``, ``LGPL 3.0``,
      ``LPPL 1.3c``, ``MIT``, ``MPL 2.0``, ``MS PL``, ``MS RL``, ``NCSA``,
      ``OFL 1.1``, ``OSL 3.0``, ``PostgreSQL``, ``Unlicense``, ``WTFPL``,
      ``zlib``, ``GMGPL 2.0``, ``GMGPL 3.0``, ``Public Domain``.

    * ``Custom``, can be used for project specific licenses.

  If the license is unknown or not in the list above, leave an empty array.

  .. code-block:: toml

   licenses = []

  For a double license:

  .. code-block:: toml

   licenses = ["GPL 3.0", "MIT"]


* ``website``: optional string. URL to the original project's website. For
  instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

     website = "https://myproject.example.org/"

* ``tags``: optional array of strings. Flat list of topics covered by the
  crate. Tags will help users find crates reletaed to their interests:

  .. code-block:: toml

     tags = ["spark", "security"]

* ``available``: optional dynamic boolean expression.  Determines whether the
  package is available for the current platform (true) or not (false). For
  instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [available.'case(distribution)']
   'debian|ubuntu' = true
   '...' = false

* ``depends-on``: optional dynamic dependencies expression common to all
  releases. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [depends-on]
   libfoo = "^1.2"

   [depends-on.'case(os)'.linux]
   libbar = "^2.0"

   [depends-on.'case(os)'.windows]
   libwinbar = "^3.0"

  Available constraint operators are the usual Ada ones (=, /=, >, >=, <, <=)
  plus caret (^, any upwards version within the same major point) and tilde
  (~, any upwards version within the same minor point). Logical operators for
  and (&), or (|) are accepted; see the ``Semantic_Versioning`` project
  documentation on `extended version sets
  <https://github.com/alire-project/semantic_versioning#types>`_.

* ``project-files``: optional list of strings. Each is a path, relative to the
  root of the source directory, to a project file to be made available.
  Expressions are accepted. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   project-files = ["my_project.gpr", "utils/utils_for_my_project.gpr"]

   [project-files.'case(word-size)']
   bits-64 = ["my_project.gpr"]
   bits-32 = ["my_project32.gpr"]

* ``gpr-externals``: optional table, giving a mapping from the name of external
  variables in the project files to sets of possible values (as array of
  strings), or an empty string if this set is infinite. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [gpr-externals]
   BUILD_MODE = ["debug", "profile", "release"]
   TAG = ""

* ``gpr-set-externals``: optional table, giving a mapping from the name of
  external variables to the values to use by default when building the project.
  Expressions are accepted before the mapping. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [gpr-set-externals]
   BUILD_MODE = "release"

   [gpr-set-externals.'case(os)']
   linux   = { OS = "gnu-linux" } # Compact table syntax is convenient in this case
   windows = { OS = "ms-linux" }  # to see all enumeration values, one per row.

* ``executables``: optional list of strings. Each one is the simple name of an
  executable provided by the package. Executables are looked for by ``alr`` in the
  build tree and must not include a path. If only one executable is given, it is
  considered the default for ``alr run``. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   executables = ["my_main"]

* ``actions``: optional list of actions to perform when installing this package.
  The general action syntax is:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [[actions]]
   type = <kind>
   command = <command>

  ``<command>`` is a an array of strings for a shell command to run in the
  source directory. ``<kind>`` can be either:

  * ``post-fetch``: the command is to be run right after getting the package
    sources;
  * ``post-compile``: the command is to be run right after GPRbuild has been
    run.

  Actions accept dynamic expressions. For example:

  .. code-block:: toml

   [[general.actions.'case(os)'.linux]]
   type = "post-fetch"
   command = ["make"]

   [[general.actions.'case(os)'.windows]]
   type = "post-fetch"
   command = ["cmd", "build"]

   [[general.actions.'case(os)'.'...']]
   # An explicit empty case alternative, which is not mandatory

Release-specific Information
----------------------------

Each release is materialized as an entry in the top-level object. The key is a
string for the version number for the release, while the value is an object to
contain the release-specific information. This object can contains the
following entries:

* ``origin``: mandatory dynamic string expression. URL used to fetch the
  sources to build. For instance:

  .. code-block:: toml

   # Clone a git repository
   origin = "git+https://github.com/example-user/example-project"

   # Download and extract a source archive
   origin = "https://example.org/archive.tar.gz"

  If the package only maps a package from the system package manager, (for
  instance ``make``), run:

  .. code-block:: json

   origin = "native:make"

  Make the expression evaluate to an empty string to mean that the package is
  not available, or just leave the alternative out. For instance, to state that
  ``make`` is available on Debian/Ubuntu and not on the other platforms:

  .. code-block:: json

   [origin.'case(distribution)']
   'debian|ubuntu' = "native:make"

* ``origin-hashes``: mandatory string array for git origins and source archives.
  An array of "kind:digest" fields that specify a hash kind and its value.
  Kinds accepted are: sha512.

* ``archive-name``: optional string. If ``origin`` points to a source archive,
  this can specifiy the name of the file to download, which is needed in order
  to properly extract the sources. For instance:

  .. code-block:: json

   origin = "https://example.org/0123456789"
   archive-name = "archive.tar.gz"
   archive-hash = "sha512:bf6082573dc537836ea8506a2c9a75dc7837440c35c5b02a52add52e38293640d99e90a9706690591f8899b8b4935824b195f230b3aa1c4da10911e3caf954c04ac"

* ``available``: optional dynamic boolean expression. It is used the following
  way:

  1. If it evaluates to ``false``, the package is not available for the current
     platform.
  2. Otherwise, the availability is determined by the ``available`` entry in
     the ``general`` section.

* ``notes``: optional string. Provides miscellanous information about this
  release. For instance:

  .. code-block:: json

   "notes": "Experimental version"

It can also contain the following entries: ``depends-on``, ``project-files``,
``gpr-externals``, ``gpr-set-externals``, ``executables``, ``actions``. These
are optional. For atomic values, these override the ones from ``general``, and
for lists/mappings, they are interpreted as additions. In the latter case,
conflicting entries are considered as errors.

External Releases
-----------------

The above information applies to regular releases distributed from sources
(that is, the Ada projects whose distribution is the main Alire goal). Some
special supporting releases also exist that are described differently.

A release is considered "external" when it is not built from sources and,
furthermore, its semantic version cannot be known until run time. Hence, the
availability and version of these releases is detected by ``alr``.

Several definitions for these external releases may exist, and so they are
defined in the index as a vector with key ``external``:

.. code-block:: json

    [[external]]
    # Common entries to all externals
    kind = "hint" # One of several predefined external kinds
    hint = "Please install SDL in your platform from source or system packages"
    # Specific external kind parameters might follow

All external kinds can define these regular properties:

*  ``available``: when defined, it restricts the external detection to the
   given environment conditions.

*  ``hint``: explanation for the user on how to make the external available. 
   This explanation is show on request with ``alr show --external``, or after
   ``alr get``, for any external dependency that could not be detected. This
   property accepts dynamic expressions.
