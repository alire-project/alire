# User-facing changes log

This document is a development diary summarizing changes in `alr` that notably
affect the user experience. It is intended as a one-stop point for users to
stay on top of `alr` new features.

### Allow working with incomplete solutions

PR [#447](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/pull/447).

Before this patch, any change in dependences that resulted in an incomplete
solution caused a final "invalid solution" error. Now, any incomplete solution
will be presented to the user with details about the unfulfilled dependencies.
This solution can be accepted and worked with normally, although the user is
responsible to provide in the environment any missing project files.

This change affects all commands that compute a dependency solution, i.e.,
`get`, `pin`, `update`, `with`.

### Use a directory to fulfill a dependency

PR [#439](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/pull/439)

A local path can now be used to fulfill a dependency. The path can be supplied
during initial dependency addition or afterwards during pinning, via the
`--use` switch. Such a path will be added to the environment generated by `alr
setenv`. Examples:

```bash
$ alr with some_crate --use /some/absolute/or/relative/path
# To simultaneously add a dependency and the directory to use for its GPR file.
# The dependency needs not to exist in the loaded indexes.

$ alr with indexed_crate
$ alr pin indexed_crate --use /path/to/gpr/containing/folder
# To pin a previously added dependency.
```
