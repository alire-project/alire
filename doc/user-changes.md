### Use a directory to fulfill a dependency

PR [#439](https://github.com/alire-project/alire/pull/439)

A local path can now be used to fulfill a dependency. The path can be supplied
during initial dependency addition or afterwards during pinning, via the
`--use` switch. Such a path will be added to the environment generated by `alr
setenv`. Examples:

```bash
$ alr with some_crate --use /some/absolute/or/relative/path
# To simultaneously add a dependency and the directory to use for its GPR file.
# The dependency needs not to exist in the loaded indexes.

$ alr with indexed_crate
$ alr pin indexed_crate --use /path/to/gpr/containing/folder
# To pin a previously added dependency.
```
