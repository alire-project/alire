# Toolchain management

Toolchains are comprised by a GNAT compiler and a `gprbuild` project file
processor. Alire strives to simplify the availability of GNAT releases, which
are packaged to be retrieved and used with ease. 

The user can now select a preferred compiler via `alr toolchain --select`.
Releases may still override this selection (for example to use a
cross-compiler).  

There are two kinds of dependencies on GNAT compilers: generic dependencies on
the `gnat` crate, which apply to every compiler, and dependencies on a precise
native or cross-compiler.

The native compiler for each platform is always `gnat_native`, whereas
cross-compilers follow the naming convention `gnat_<target>` (e.g.,
`gnat_riscv_elf`). Alire will only offer to install valid cross-compilers for
the host platform.

## Identifying available compilers

Compilers available for download can be listed with
`alr search --full --external-detect gnat_`.
They will also be shown by the selection assistant,
`alr toolchain --select`.

Running `alr toolchain` without arguments will show the installed compilers and
the preferred compiler, if any.

## Manual compiler installation

Besides selecting a default compiler with `alr toolchain --select`, the user
may install other compilers via `alr toolchain --install`. Installed but
unselected compilers will not be used, though, unless a crate explicitly
requests them via dependencies.

Compilers can be removed with `alr toolchain --uninstall`.

## Automatic compiler installation

If a crate requires a target-specific compiler via its dependencies, `alr` will
attempt to use first a matching installed compiler. Otherwise, a matching
compiler will be automatically downloaded.

Generic dependencies on `gnat` will never cause a compiler download.

## Automatic compiler selection by Alire

When a build is launched, or `alr printenv` is run to obtain a build environment,
`alr` will use the available compilers as follows:

1. Any target-specific compiler needed due to dependencies will be
selected.
1. Otherwise, if the user has defined a preferred compiler, it will be
selected.
1. If no preferred compiler has been defined, Alire will rely on the existing
user environment.

## Specifying dependencies on GNAT compilers for crate publishing

From the point of view of a user preparing a release for publication, these
are the considerations to bear in mind:

- Do not use any dependency on a compiler if you do not have a reason to do so.
- Use dependencies on `gnat` to specify known compiler version restrictions.
- Use dependencies on a precise gnat cross-compiler (e.g., `gnat_riscv_elf`)
  when your crate is purposely only available for such a target.
- It is normally not necessary to specify a dependency on the native compiler
  (`gnat_native`) as that would unnecessarily limit the availability of a
  library crate that might be useful to dependent cross-target crates.
- It may be useful to depend on `gnat_native` in cases where a crate builds a
  tool to be used always in the host platform, for example to be used in some
  action during the build process.

## Note about cross-compilation

Independently of the compiler made available by `alr` in the environment, the
crate project file still must define an appropriate `Target` attribute for the
desired compiler. At the moment, Alire does not examine project file contents
to identify necessary compilers, and relies only on regular `depends-on`
dependencies.
