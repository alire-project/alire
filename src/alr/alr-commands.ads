   type Command is limited interface;
   --  This type encapsulates configuration and execution of a specific
   --  command. It also has help-related subprograms. Help is structured as:
   --  1. SUMMARY, showing <one-liner explanation>
   --  <one-liner explanation> is provided by Short_Description (see below).
   --
   --  2. USAGE, "alr [global options] command [command options]" & [args text]
   --  [args text] is provided by Usage_Custom_Paramenters (see below).
   --
   --  3. GLOBAL OPTIONS explanation.
   --  Autogenerated by GNAT.Command_Line.
   --  Global arguments are set up by alr for all commands.
   --
   --  4. COMMAND OPTIONS explanation (if existing).
   --  Autogenerated by GNAT.Command_Line.
   --  Command switches are set up by each command with Setup_Switches (below).

   --  5. DESCRIPTION, custom detailed command explanation.
   --  Commands provide this text with Long_Description (see below).
