   --------------
   -- Policies --
   --------------

   type Age_Policies is (Oldest, Newest);
   --  When looking for releases within a crate, which one to try first.

   type Completeness_Policies is
     (First_Complete,
      --  Stop after finding the first complete solution. No incomplete
      --  solutions will be attempted. Other complete solutions may exist
      --  that are globally "newer".

      All_Complete,
      --  Only attempt to find complete solutions; the first unsatisfiable
      --  dependency will result in abandoning that search branch. All
      --  complete solutions will be found, and the best one according
      --  to Solutions.Is_Better will be returned.

      Some_Incomplete,
      --  Explores a reasonable subset of incomplete solutions: unknown crates,
      --  crates with no satisfying releases, crates with externals can appear
      --  as missing in the solution.

      All_Incomplete
      --  All crates may appear as missing, even those that have satisfying
      --  releases. All possible solutions and incomplete subsets are
      --  eventually explored.

     );
   --  Allow the solver to further explore incomplete solution space. Each
   --  value takes more time than the precedent one. All_Incomplete can take
   --  a veeery long time when many crates/releases must be considered. TODO:
   --  All these policies can go away once we move from a recursive solver to
   --  a non-recursive priority-based one.

   type Detection_Policies is (Detect, Dont_Detect);
   --  * Detect: externals will be detected and added to the index once needed.
   --  * Dont_Detect: externals will remain undetected (faster).

   type Hinting_Policies is (Hint, Fail);
   --  * Hint: any crate with externals, detected or not, will as last resort
   --  provide a hint.
   --  * Fail: fail for any unsatisfiable crate. If Detect, externally detected
   --  releases will be used normally; otherwise a crate with only externals
   --  will always cause failure.

   type Sharing_Policies is (Allow_Shared, Only_Local);
   --  * Allow_Shared: crates in the shared config can appear in solutions.
   --  * Only_Local: only crates in the local workspace will be used.

   type Timeout_Policies is
     (Ask,      -- Normal interaction with user
      Stop,     -- Abort at first timeout
      Continue, -- Never ask and continue searching
      Continue_While_Complete_Then_Stop
      --  If there are complete solutions unexplored, continue searching.
      --  Once complete are exhausted, the timeout timer will be reset and the
      --  policy downgraded to Stop. This is intended to abort as soon as we
      --  know there aren't complete solutions, but also to be able to provide
      --  a decent incomplete solution so the problem can be diagnosed.
     );

   subtype Release  is Types.Release;
   subtype Solution is Solutions.Solution;

   --  The dependency solver (Resolve subprogram, below) receives a
   --  dependency tree and will return the best solution found (exploration
   --  is exhaustive), according to Solutions.Is_Better ordering. System
   --  dependencies are resolved in platforms with system packager support.
   --  Otherwise they're filed as "hints". In this case, a warning will
   --  be provided for the user with a list of the dependencies that are
   --  externally required. Note that a solution is always returned, but
   --  it might not be complete.
