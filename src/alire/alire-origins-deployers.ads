   -- Deployer --
   --------------

   type Deployer is abstract tagged private;
   --  Type that encapsulates the particulars of every origin and knows how
   --  to deploy it on disk.

   function New_Deployer (From : Origin) return Deployer'Class;
   --  Factory that wraps an Origin with its appropriate deployer

   --  Derivations of Deployer override (some of) the following:

   function Already_Installed (This : Deployer) return Boolean is (False)
     with Pre'Class => This.Is_Native;
   --  Say if a native package is already installed in this system. Unneeded
   --  otherwise.

   function Base (This : Deployer) return Origin;
   --  Return the origin for which this deployer was created

   function Exists (This : Deployer) return Boolean is (False)
     with Pre'Class => This.Is_Native;
   --  Says if a native package exists in this system. Unneeded otherwise.

   function Deploy (This : Deployer; Folder : String) return Outcome;
   --  Deploy the origin designated by This to the given Folder. This installs
   --  packages for native origins and fetches sources for other origins.
   --
   --  IMPORTANT: when implementing a new package manager support, take care
   --  of failing if an installation would imply removal of packages. For
   --  instance with apt-get, use the --no-remove switch.
   --
   --  This is critical since some packages may request the installation of
   --  the platform GNAT, which in turn could trigger the removal of another
   --  platform-packaged-but-not-default compiler.
   --
   --  E.g., in current Ubuntu, gnat depends on gnat-7. If you are using
   --  gnat-8, any package depending on gnat would remove gnat-8.  And, in any
   --  case, it is polite not to uninstall anything installed in the user
   --  system.

   function Is_Native (This : Deployer) return Boolean;
   --  Whether This targets a package from the system's package manager

   function Native_Version (This : Deployer) return String is ("native")
     with Pre'Class => This.Is_Native;
   --  Return the version number for the package
