   --  Actual fetching logic.
   --  A deployer is invoked thrice during retrieval of a release, in order:

   --  2. Compute_Hashes: should compute the instructed hash with a method
   --     appropriated to the origin.
   --  3. Deploy: deploy the sources in its final location in compilable state.
