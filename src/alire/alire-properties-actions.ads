      On_Demand   -- On demand from command-line
     );

   --  The "lifecycle" of releases in Alire is described here. For all pre/post
   --  actions, dependencies are visited in a safe order, and the root is
   --  visited last. E.g., for the following dependency graph:

   --  R +-> A --> B --|
   --    |-> D --------+-> C

   --  C will be visited first. Then B and D will be visited, potentially
   --  simultaneously. Then, A will be visited, and then R will be visited.

   --  In the following descriptions, "for all releases" includes releases
   --  user-pinned as a link to a folder/remote.

   --  * Post_Fetch is triggered for all releases whenever there is a change in
   --  dependencies, which includes just after retrieval via `alr get` or `alr
   --  with`. In addition, running `alr update` will also trigger Post_Fetch,
   --  even when there are no updates to apply.

   --  * Pre_Build is triggered for all releases whenever a build is going to
   --  happen, which currently is on `alr build`, `alr run`, `alr get --build`.

   --  * Post_Build is triggered for all releases after a build completes.

   --  * Test is triggered only for the root crate after the crate build (and
   --  after all Post_Build complete), only when `alr index-test` is run.
