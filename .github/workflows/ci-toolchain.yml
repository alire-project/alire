# Build Alire with `alr build` and using a toolchain installed from Alire
# The `alr` being tested is the one which is being submitted in the PR
# Toolchain is tested from `alr install` (1st build) and `alr build` (2nd
# build), so those are two different toolchain installations of the same
# toolchain. This way we not only test that alr builds itself, but that
# toolchain installations via `alr install` work as intented.
